# DIY

Python web framework built for learning, just as the name suggests which is an acronym for **do it yourself**, I try to created this web framework for learning purposes only and tried to apply what I had learned so far.

## Inspiration

this project was heavily inspired from Ruslan Pivak's blog, although the blog post is not about creating a web framework, at least from that post it gives me a ideas of how a web framework is formed, and after reading Florimond Manca's blog post where did he create a web framework called bocadillo and become maintainer, also i was inspired after read an article titled "Web application from scratch". Big thanks to Ruslan Pivak and Florimond Manca, who in turn me to be inspired to try create a something new. You can check [Bocadilla repos](https://github.com/bocadilloproject/bocadillo) and give it try to read their article.

## tl;dr

This web framework is a type of WSGI framework, so it is possible to run on WSGI server using Gunicorn. besides, the web framework is mostly designed according to the WebOb library documentation.
