# DIY

Python web framework built for learning, just as the name suggests which is an acronym for **do it yourself**, I try to created this web framework for learning purposes only and tried to apply what I had learned so far.

## Behind this Project

Hi!

my name is Ryan Febriansyah (or you can call me ryan) and is an informatics engineering student, i was very interested in the world of web development although I was just starting to get into this area about 8 months ago. Currently, i began to dare myself to try something new (whether it was reckless or indeed because it was stupid), and satisfy my curiosity about the development of the web framework itself.

Beside this project, i also started to often make small contributions (make a small PR, fixed some error or bug, translated a documentation and discussion an issue) to Django Framework, Django Rest Framework, Github, and several other open source projects. You can hit me in my [github links](https://github.com/sodrooome)

## Inspiration

this project was heavily inspired from Ruslan Pivak's blog, although the blog post is not about creating a web framework, at least from that post it gives me a ideas of how a web framework is formed, and after reading Florimond Manca's blog post where did he create a web framework called bocadillo and become maintainer, also i was inspired after read an article titled "Web application from scratch". Big thanks to Ruslan Pivak and Florimond Manca, who in turn me to be inspired to try create a something new. You can check [Bocadillo repos](https://github.com/bocadilloproject/bocadillo) and give it try to read their article.

## tl;dr

This web framework is a type of WSGI framework, so it is possible to run on WSGI server using Gunicorn. besides, this web framework is mostly designed according to the WebOb library documentation.
